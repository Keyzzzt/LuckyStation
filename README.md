# Welcome to my project.
## If you read this file, this means that I'm looking for a React Developer position.
## Shortly about this project
    This is Ecommerce App with MERN stack and TypeScript on top of it.
    ESLINT for cleaner code.
    If you will clone this project it will not work on your side. It is missing .env file with environment variables. If you are going to take an in-depth look into the project, I can send it to you. Then you will be able to launch it.
    Project has not SSR yet, but I will implement it.

    Written with Express framework, TypeScript, Mongoose and MongoDB.
## Frontend
    Project generated with create-react-app.
